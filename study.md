# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
The model layer is a representation of the database. It returns a list of data
to the controller. 
```

## Define Controller Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
The controller receives user input, and then gets data from a model and uses a
view to generate HTML output. It's kind of like the messenger between models and
views.
```

## Define Router Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
It connects URLS to code and generates paths and URLS from code.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
GET request --> router -- decides which controller to send the request to -->
controller gets from the model (which is a representation of the database) -->
generates output, which alters the view.

```
